The most humble of priestly spells is the orison, a brief prayer or
invocation of a minor nature. Typically, priests learn a number of
orisons as acolytes or students in order to hone their spellcasting
skills and emphasize concepts, ideals, or phrases of particular
importance to the faith. Because an orisons is not even on par with
other 1st-level magic, a priest memorizes a number of individual orisons
equal to three +1 per level (up to a maximum of nine) when he devotes a
1st-level spell slot to orison. In other words, a 1st-level priest can
memorize four orisons for one 1st-level spell slot, a 2nd-level priest
can memorize five, and so on.

Unlike /Cantrip/ (which is not found in the AFAL campaign anyway), an
orison must have a specific effect, which must be chosen when the orison
is memorized. Regardless of the prayer chosen, the orison's duration is
never more than one round per level. The orisons that a particular
priest can cast depend on the spheres available to that priest, so, for
example, a druid can cast orisons in the plant and animal spheres, but
not one from the necromantic or sun sphere. Known orisons include the
following:

Alleviate (/Healing/):
    A single creature suffering from nausea or pain is relieved of its
    discomfort. Magically induced nausea or pain is only alleviated if
    the victim passes a saving throw vs. spell with a -2 penalty.
Buddy (/Guardian/):
    Caster feels a tugging on his/her left earlobe whenever
    someone/thing approaches caster from behind for orisons duration.
    Any living or animated creature on casters left shoulder negates
    this orison.
Calm (/Charm/Animal/):
    A single person (Charm sphere version) or creature (Animal shere)
    that has been startled or frightened is soothed. Victims suffering
    from magical fear may attempt a save vs. spell with a -2 penalty to
    calm themselves.
Clarity (/All/):
    For the duration of the orison, the priest's speech is clear and
    free of impediment - useful for readings from sacred texts and other
    such rites. Magical conditions such as confuse languages cannot be
    overcome by this orison.
Consensus Result (/Law/):
    Person touched makes a roll in the next round 3 times. Median is
    taken as the result (i.e. (1,3,8) = 3, (1,6,14) = 6, (1,9,16) = 9,
    etc.). What this means.

Courage (/Combat/):
    The priest gains a +1 bonus to his next attack roll, as long as the
    attack is made within the spell's duration.
Cup (/Creation/):
    Priest calls into being a plain tin cup which lasts for orisons
    duration. At higher levels priest may instead create a bowl (2nd),
    bucket (5th), washbasin (8th), or bathtub (12th).
Extreme Result (/Chaos/):
    Person touched makes a roll in the next round 3 times. Greatest
    outlier is taken as the result (i.e. (1,3,8) = 8, (1,6,14) = 14,
    (1,9,16) = 1, etc.). If equal difference between numbers (2,9,16),
    roll is chosen randomly from max and min roll. What this means.

Fertilize (/Plant/):
    Cause up to 1 man-sized or smaller plant per level or a single
    larger one to grow more healthy for a day. Regular treatment with
    this orison can result in remarkably beautiful flowers, award
    winning vegetables, trees of maximum possible height, etc.
Glow (/Sun/):
    Causes a nonliving object held by priest to glow with dim light
    (roughly candlelight, sufficient for reading) for orisons duration.
Guidance (/Thought/):
    The priest gains a +1 bonus to a Wisdom or Intelligence check to
    determine the right course of action in a moral dilemma or puzzle.
Healing (/Healing/):
    By his touch, the priest may heal a creature of 1 point of damage.
Line in the Sand (/Wards/):
    Caster draws a line in the sand/soil or chalks one on a hard floor
    (max 1'/level). Whenever line is crossed wihin spells duration,
    caster will know.
Magic sense (/Divination/):
    If there is a persistent spell effect or magical item within 10
    yards, the priest feels a recognizable tingle or sensation of some
    kind. He has no way to determine what item or spell may have caused
    the reaction.
Memory (/Thought/):
    Any item the priest commits to memory during the spell duration is
    more completely and permanently learned; he gains a +2 bonus to any
    checks to recall the exact appearance, wording, or meaning of an
    item, text, or message.
Pest (/Summoning/):
    Calls forth a buzzing, semi-solid, fly-like spirit that flies at
    speed 8 (MC C) and can be made to buzz in an opponents ear. Targets
    making attacks must save vs. spells at +2 or suffer a -2 penalty to
    hit that round, spellcasters must save at +1 for each even point of
    INT or WIS above 9 (10=+1, 12=+2, etc.) each round to avoid spell
    failure.
Pinch (/Elemental/):
    Create a small flame or a number of droplets of water, small
    pebbles, or CCs of air equal to half the priests level, rounded up.
    Flame lasts one round unless created on a dry, easily ignited
    material. These materials can be used as spell components.
Preserve (/Necromantic/):
    Flowers or other cut plants treated with this orison and kept in
    water will stay fresh twice as long, although they will not survive
    or grow new roots, even if they otherwise might have.
Repair Shoe (/Travellers/):
    Functions as the Wizard spell mending on shoes worn by person or
    mount touched.
Resistance to magic (/Protection/):
    The caster gains a +1 bonus to his next saving throw against magic
    of any type, as long as it occurs during the orison's duration.
Resistance to poison (/Protection/):
    The priest gains a +1 bonus to his next saving throw vs. poison, as
    long as it occurs during the orison's duration.
Sense Commitment (/War/):
    Sense if a group of enemies has standard moralle for that creature
    type of if it is being modified up or down by some factor.
Sense Gate (/Astral/):
    Allows priest to determine if a specific object or portal is
    currently an active gate to a specific outer or astral plane named
    by the priest. Above 8th level, priest may generalize to "The Abyss"
    instead of "The 62nd layer of the Abyss".
Storm Sense (/Weather/):
    Allows caster to predict to within 3 minutes (GM adds d7-3 to
    correct time) when an aproaching (less than 3hrs away) rain- or
    snowfall will begin.
Verbalacrity (/Time/):
    Lower casting time of spell cast next round by 1 seg/5 levels of
    caster (round up, caster only)

Other orisons of similar power or scope may be permitted by the GM.
Generally, an orison should not affect more than one creature or die
roll at a time, and an orison that can actually cause immediate harm to
a creature should inflict no more than 1 or 2 points of damage. An
offensive orison would be quite rare and most probably associated with
an evil or chaotic priesthood.
